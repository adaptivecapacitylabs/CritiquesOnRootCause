# Collection of critiques on "root cause"

## Overview

This document contains links and excerpts from literature that provide critique on the concept "root cause" an addition to how the term is used. These references are from authors across a wide variety of fields (such as safety science, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and others) as well as many different domains (such as aviation, medicine, software, military, power generation, and others).

### On the concept

Dekker, S., Hollnagel, E., Woods, D., & Cook, R. (2008). Resilience Engineering: [New directions for measuring and maintaining safety in complex systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238687807_Resilience_Engineering_New_directions_for_measuring_and_maintaining_safety_in_complex_systems). Lund University School of Aviation, 1, 1-6.


>(p.6) Accidents were initially viewed as the conclusion of a sequence of events (which involved “human errors” as causes or contributors). This is now being increasingly replaced by a systemic view in which accidents emerge from the complexity of people’s activities in an organizational and technical context. These activities are typically focused on preventing accidents, but also involve other goals (throughput, production, efficiency, cost control) which means that goal conflicts can arise, always under the pressure of limited resources (e.g. time, money, expertise). Accidents emerge from a confluence of conditions and occurrences that are usually associated with the pursuit of success, but in this combination—each necessary but only jointly sufficient—able to trigger failure instead.

>Accidents are not the result of an initiating (root cause) event that triggers a series of events, which eventually leads to a loss. Instead, accidents result from interactions among components that violate the safety constraints on system design and operation, by which feedback and control inputs can grow increasingly at odds with the real problem or processes to be controlled.

Root Cause Seduction
> 
> The identification of a root cause means that the analysis has found the source of the event and so everyone can focus
on fixing the problem. This satisfies people’s need to avoid ambiguous situations in which one lacks essential information to make a decision
(Frisch & Baron, 1988) or experiences a salient knowledge gap (Loewenstein, 1993). The seductiveness of singular root causes may also feed into, and be supported by, the general tendency to be over-confident about how much we know (Fischhoff,Slovic,& Lichtenstein, 1977).

> However, theorists and researchers who have studied causal reasoning recognize that the assignment of causality is ambiguous or mistaken in several ways (Rasmussen, 1990). Most simple there is unlikely to be a single cause for any serious or surprising event. Instead,there is a confluence of behaviors, conditions, and circumstances that have developed over time (Reason, 1990), with precursors that have gone unheeded (Weick& Roberts,1993).

> Accidents in such systems occur when multiple factors together erode, bypass, or break through the multiple defenses creating the trajectory for an accident. While each of these factors is necessary for an accident, they are only jointly sufficient. As a result, there is no single cause for a failure but a dynamic interplay of multiple contributors. The search for a single or root cause retards our ability to understand the interplay of multiple contributors.

> This theory simplifies the idea of causation by limiting the search for cause to singular 'chains of events', which does not take into account the complexity of nature (e.g. fire), where multiple action chains may exist concurrently. One property of a complex system is emergence, which refers to phenomena that are new and not explicable by the properties of their components (2009; S. E. Page, 2011). This is different than resultant phenomena, which can be linked directly to other entities or events.

> (p. 2) Both hindsight and outcome bias have been convincingly demonstrated in a number of fields, including medicine. These biases are powerful and insidious and make it hard for historical analyses (such as root cause analysis or closed claim review) to yield useful understandings of accidents or adverse events.

### On the usage of the term

Peerally, M. F., Carr, S., Waring, J., & Dixon-Woods, M. (2017). [The problem with root cause analysis](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/26/5/417.full.pdf). BMJ quality & safety, 26(5), 417-422.

> The first problem with RCA is its name. By implying—even inadvertently—that a single root cause (or a small number of causes) can be found, the term ‘root cause analysis’ promotes a flawed reductionist view.

[Analysis of clinical incidents: a window on the system not a search for root causes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8420168_Analysis_of_clinical_incidents_A_window_on_the_system_not_a_search_for_root_causes).

> The term ‘‘root cause analysis’’, while widespread, is misleading in a number of respects. To begin with, it implies that there is a single root cause, or at least a small number. Typically, however, the picture that emerges is much more fluid and the notion of a root cause is a gross oversimplification.
