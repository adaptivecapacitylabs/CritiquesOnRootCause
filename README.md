# Collection of critiques on "root cause"

## Overview

This document contains links and excerpts from literature that provide critique on the concept "root cause" an addition to how the term is used. These references are from authors across a wide variety of fields (such as safety science, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and others) as well as many different domains (such as aviation, medicine, software, military, power generation, and others).

### On the concept

>(p.6) Accidents were initially viewed as the conclusion of a sequence of events (which involved “human errors” as causes or contributors). This is now being increasingly replaced by a systemic view in which accidents emerge from the complexity of people’s activities in an organizational and technical context. These activities are typically focused on preventing accidents, but also involve other goals (throughput, production, efficiency, cost control) which means that goal conflicts can arise, always under the pressure of limited resources (e.g. time, money, expertise). Accidents emerge from a confluence of conditions and occurrences that are usually associated with the pursuit of success, but in this combination—each necessary but only jointly sufficient—able to trigger failure instead.

>Accidents are not the result of an initiating (root cause) event that triggers a series of events, which eventually leads to a loss. Instead, accidents result from interactions among components that violate the safety constraints on system design and operation, by which feedback and control inputs can grow increasingly at odds with the real problem or processes to be controlled.

Root Cause Seduction
> 
> The identification of a root cause means that the analysis has found the source of the event and so everyone can focus
on fixing the problem. This satisfies people’s need to avoid ambiguous situations in which one lacks essential information to make a decision
(Frisch & Baron, 1988) or experiences a salient knowledge gap (Loewenstein, 1993). The seductiveness of singular root causes may also feed into, and be supported by, the general tendency to be over-confident about how much we know (Fischhoff,Slovic,& Lichtenstein, 1977).

> However, theorists and researchers who have studied causal reasoning recognize that the assignment of causality is ambiguous or mistaken in several ways (Rasmussen, 1990). Most simple there is unlikely to be a single cause for any serious or surprising event. Instead,there is a confluence of behaviors, conditions, and circumstances that have developed over time (Reason, 1990), with precursors that have gone unheeded (Weick& Roberts,1993).

> Accidents in such systems occur when multiple factors together erode, bypass, or break through the multiple defenses creating the trajectory for an accident. While each of these factors is necessary for an accident, they are only jointly sufficient. As a result, there is no single cause for a failure but a dynamic interplay of multiple contributors. The search for a single or root cause retards our ability to understand the interplay of multiple contributors.

> This theory simplifies the idea of causation by limiting the search for cause to singular 'chains of events', which does not take into account the complexity of nature (e.g. fire), where multiple action chains may exist concurrently. One property of a complex system is emergence, which refers to phenomena that are new and not explicable by the properties of their components (2009; S. E. Page, 2011). This is different than resultant phenomena, which can be linked directly to other entities or events.

> (p. 126) In the past, as a safety leader, when investigating an accident or injury I would start at the event and ask “Why?” five times looking for the “root cause.” This approach seemed to satisfy my basic need to understand and explain why the event occurred and then gave me the ability to fix something. As a safety leader and experienced engi- neer, it seemed like a concise method and provided me with an explain- able linear path that led to the failure. Fix the root cause, and the problem was solved. The problem with my thinking was multifaceted. First, I have found that I was so focused on finding a “root cause” that I was not look- ing at all of the conditions that led to the event. As I began to change my approach, I noticed that if I focused more on learning and discovery instead of fixing. I ended up with a more comprehensive story of “how” the event occurred, instead of just “why.” It has also become quite evi- dent to me that failure is not so linear as I thought. The 5-whys approach tended to build a linear path of what appeared to be “cause and effect” where I think it actually was more of an “effect-and-cause” picture of the event. I would see the effect and then sort of create or determine the cause. The more Learning Teams I led, the more I realized that failure is actually incredibly complicated in most situations.
It now seems to me that there is no real path to failure or “chain of events” as we used to talk about in the army. I have reached a point now where I do not think there is a “root cause” or even “root causes.” It seems to me that many of the things that lead to failure are simply normal vari- ability that eventually align in such a fashion with other conditions and hazards that lead to something bad happening. In fact, the search for root cause had often led me to believe I had fixed the problem when actually I only fixed one piece of the failure; perhaps it was only the triggering event. In reality, there were numerous other conditions that coupled to bring about the bad event.

### On the usage of the term

> The first problem with RCA is its name. By implying—even inadvertently—that a single root cause (or a small number of causes) can be found, the term ‘root cause analysis’ promotes a flawed reductionist view.

[Analysis of clinical incidents: a window on the system not a search for root causes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8420168_Analysis_of_clinical_incidents_A_window_on_the_system_not_a_search_for_root_causes).

> The term ‘‘root cause analysis’’, while widespread, is misleading in a number of respects. To begin with, it implies that there is a single root cause, or at least a small number. Typically, however, the picture that emerges is much more fluid and the notion of a root cause is a gross oversimplification.
