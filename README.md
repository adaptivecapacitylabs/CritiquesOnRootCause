# Collection of critiques on "root cause"

## Overview

This document contains links and excerpts from literature that provide critique on the concept "root cause" an addition to how the term is used. These references are from authors across a wide variety of fields (such as safety science, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and others) as well as many different domains (such as aviation, medicine, software, military, power generation, and others).

### On the concept

Johannesen, L., Sarter, N., Cook, R., Dekker, S., & Woods, D. D. (2012). [Behind Human Error](https://bookshop.org/books/behind-human-error/9780754678342). Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..

> Accidents in such systems occur when multiple factors together erode, bypass, or break through the multiple defenses creating the trajectory for an accident. While each of these factors is necessary for an accident, they are only jointly sufficient. As a result, there is no single cause for a failure but a dynamic interplay of multiple contributors. The search for a single or root cause retards our ability to understand the interplay of multiple contributors.

> This theory simplifies the idea of causation by limiting the search for cause to singular 'chains of events', which does not take into account the complexity of nature (e.g. fire), where multiple action chains may exist concurrently. One property of a complex system is emergence, which refers to phenomena that are new and not explicable by the properties of their components (2009; S. E. Page, 2011). This is different than resultant phenomena, which can be linked directly to other entities or events.


### On the usage of the term

Peerally, M. F., Carr, S., Waring, J., & Dixon-Woods, M. (2017). [The problem with root cause analysis](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/26/5/417.full.pdf). BMJ quality & safety, 26(5), 417-422.

> The first problem with RCA is its name. By implying—even inadvertently—that a single root cause (or a small number of causes) can be found, the term ‘root cause analysis’ promotes a flawed reductionist view.

[Analysis of clinical incidents: a window on the system not a search for root causes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8420168_Analysis_of_clinical_incidents_A_window_on_the_system_not_a_search_for_root_causes).

> The term ‘‘root cause analysis’’, while widespread, is misleading in a number of respects. To begin with, it implies that there is a single root cause, or at least a small number. Typically, however, the picture that emerges is much more fluid and the notion of a root cause is a gross oversimplification.
